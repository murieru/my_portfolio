            Hello, my name is Muriel Hediger. I am a Swiss designer born in 1989 in Lausanne. 
            Nowadays, I live and work mainly in Lugano and ZÃ¼rich. Since 2013, I have been focusing on graphic design and photography. 
            Over time, my expertise has expanded to include interaction design, covering UX and UI design, as well as coding. 
            I love bringing people together and creating powerful teams to develop simple and beautiful products.<br/>
