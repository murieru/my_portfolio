            <p>
            My name is Muriel Hediger, I was born in 1989 in Lausanne. 
            Currently, I live and work across Lugano, ZÃ¼rich, and Lausanne. 
            Since 2013, I have been a freelance designer, initially focusing on graphic design and photography. 
            Over time, my expertise has evolved to cover UX and UI design, as well as coding. 
            I am passionate about creating simple and beautiful products and enjoy leading projects from their inception to completion.
